Components

Heater - https://e3d-online.com/high-temperature-heater-cartridges
65W @ 24V
RAMBo 1.3 MOSFETs can handle
Rated at 117W, 89A
Connector of heater is not compatible with the port on M3, potential mod?
Solution: Remove the old heater block wires from the screw terminal and replace with the 65W heater wires.
Zip tie through the back to the filament drive 

Heat Break - https://e3d-online.com/v6-titanium-heat-break-1-75mm
Lower heat conductivity
Maybe not necessary - requires further testing
Alternative: https://e3d-online.com/v6-heat-break
Plated Copper Heater Block - https://e3d-online.com/v6-plated-copper-heater-block
Aluminum heater blocks will soften at high temperatures

High Temp PTFE tubing - https://e3d-online.com/capricorn-bowden-tubing-100mm
For heat sink
Normal PTFE will melt with high temp. Materials such as PEEK

PT100 Temperature Sensor - https://e3d-online.com/pt100-temperature-sensor
Accurately reads temperatures up to 400 deg. C
Alternative: https://e3d-online.com/type-k-thermocouple-cartridge
Requires a different amplifier board

PT100 Amplifier Board - https://e3d-online.com/pt100-amplifier-board
Required for the PT100 Temperature Sensor to work
Requires Vcc and GND pins from RAMBo 1.3
Signal pin must be connected to analog input of RAMBo 1.3
Explained later


Threaded Heat Sink - https://e3d-online.com/v6-threaded-heatsink
Alternative groove mount: https://e3d-online.com/v6-heatsink-1-75mm-universal








Firmware Changes -  attached in Marlin firmware

Configuration.h

temperature sensor 1 changed to match signal from PT100 amplifier board.

pins_RAMBO.h

temp sensor 1 pin changed to match signal pin on analog pins input.

GCode Changes
http://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/
	These changes save to the EEPROM of the RAMBo board, and are not changed when updating the firmware of the board.  

Offset between nozzle - M218 command
T1 specifies extruder head, X/Y/Z specifies axis. 
For vertical adjustments, use Z.
-33.26 worked with an M3 with a normal T0, and a modded T1 with Ryanâ€™s 3D printed mount
Negative values move the bed further from the hotend (down).

Autotune PID - M303 

        M303 E1 S265 C10

This will run 10 cycles of PID autotuning based on 265 deg. C.
Copy the PID settings into M301, using P, I, and D before each number to change their respective values.
